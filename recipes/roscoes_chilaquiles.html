    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For salsa roja, pour boiling water over peppers and let sit until softened, 15 to 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a skillet over high heat, and sear tomatoes, onions, and garlic until charred for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place softened peppers, charred vegetables, and 1 cup of the chile soaking water in a blender. Reserve remaining 3 cups chile water.  Blend until smooth. Strain the sauce; pour back into the pan. </li>
        <li>Cook sauce over medium heat, scraping any charred bits from the bottom of the pan; add 2 cups of remaining chile water. Simmer until sauce is reduced by 1/3. Stir in bouillon cube and last 1 cup chile water, culantro leaves, lime juice; stir until bouillon cube dissolves. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>For chilaquiles, heat oil to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C) in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add tortillas and fry until crisp and golden. 2 minutes per batch. </li>
        <li>For each serving, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small nonstick pan over medium heat. Crack an egg into the skillet, and cook until outer edges become opaque, about 1 minute. Turn egg over and cook until whites are completely opaque, 1 to 2 minutes more. </li>
        <li>Add a handful of chips to the salsa roja, and turn to coat completely. Remove to a serving plate with a slotted spoon. </li>
        <li>Drizzle with crema, top with an egg, cotija cheese, avocado, cilantro, squeeze of lime juice, and drizzle with more salsa roja. Sprinkle with oregano. Repeat with remaining ingredients. </li>
